Original project founded and created by George L. Allen (2011)
Updated by Patrick Conwell (2014)

This project aims to update Mr. Allen's original project (which appears
to have been abandoned approximately 2 years ago (as of Aug 2014), and will
be focused on a linux system (Ubuntu, specifically).

My goals starting out are to make a 'shell' memo that uses only packages that
are installed by default in texlive on ubuntu to maximize portability and
ease of use for less technically inclinded individuals.

At this time (24 Aug 2014), the shell is 95% complete and is usable. The
code is ugly as hell, but it works well. Ultimately, I'm going to clean up
the shell to make the code prettier and create a second 'advanced' shell
that will require user packages to be installed, but will have a lot more
functionality (eg enumeration). I doubt I'll get around to it, but I'd like
to one day create a python (or some language) script that takes user input and
spits out a fully formatted pdf memo - but don't hold your breath on that one.
